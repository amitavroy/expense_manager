This application is an Expense manager that I want to use to track my expenses. 

It should allow me to track my expenses, incomes. It should also allow me to keep a track of my bills.

## Technology used

Right now, this project uses 
- Laravel 
- Inertiajs 
- React with Typescript

This is based on the React starter kit of Laravel.
Database used for development has been SQLite. However, it should run easily on MySQL and even PGSql

## Transactions

The **Transactions** module will allow you to add expenses. Every expense is linked to a **Bank account**. When you add an expense transaction, you need to select the account. And, the same amount is deducted from your account.

When you edit a transaction, we are also handling the scenarios like user changing the category and even account. The account balances are also updated based on the new edited transaction.

## Billers

Users will be able to add **Billers** and their **Bills**. Based on that, Bills will be available on Dashboard for payment. When a Bill is paid, it will also get added to the Expenses with correct category.


```
select t.*, u.name, c.name, c.type
from transactions as t
join users as u on u.id = t.user_id
join categories as c on c.id = t.category_id
where c.type = 'expense'
```
